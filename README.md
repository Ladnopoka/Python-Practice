# LeetCode Practice Repository

This repository is dedicated to my LeetCode grinding journey, focusing on mastering essential data structures and algorithms for technical interviews.

## Essential Data Structures

1. Arrays
   - Foundation for many algorithms
   - Random access, good locality
   - Core operations: insertion, deletion, traversal

2. Hashmaps
   - O(1) average case lookup
   - Key-value pair storage
   - Handle collisions effectively

3. Trees
   - Binary trees, BST, AVL trees
   - Hierarchical data representation
   - Tree traversal patterns

4. Linked Lists
   - Sequential access
   - Dynamic size
   - Singly and doubly linked

5. Stacks
   - LIFO principle
   - Push/pop operations
   - Used in parsing, backtracking

6. Queues
   - FIFO principle
   - Enqueue/dequeue operations
   - BFS implementation

7. Graphs
   - Vertices and edges
   - Directed/undirected
   - Weighted/unweighted

## Core Algorithms

1. Insertion Sort
   - Simple implementation
   - Good for small n
   - O(n¬≤) time complexity

2. Merge Sort
   - Divide and conquer
   - Stable sort
   - O(n log n) time complexity

3. Quick Sort
   - In-place sorting
   - Widely used
   - Average O(n log n)

4. Binary Search
   - Divide and conquer
   - Requires sorted array
   - O(log n) time complexity

5. Greedy Algorithm
   - Local optimal choice
   - Used for optimization
   - Not always globally optimal

6. Breadth-First Search
   - Level by level traversal
   - Shortest path in unweighted graphs
   - Uses queue

7. Depth-First Search
   - Explores as far as possible
   - Uses stack/recursion
   - Tree/graph traversal

## Big O Notation

Understanding time and space complexity is crucial:
- O(1): Constant time
- O(log n): Logarithmic
- O(n): Linear
- O(n log n): Linearithmic
- O(n¬≤): Quadratic
- O(2‚Åø): Exponential

Remember: Always analyze both time and space complexity when solving problems!

This repository serves as my reference guide for continuous learning and improvement in data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques. Keep grinding! üí™
