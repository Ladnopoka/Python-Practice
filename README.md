# LeetCode Practice Environment

This repository contains a template for solving LeetCode problems in Python.

## Template Structure

The `leetcode_template.py` file includes:
- Common imports used in LeetCode problems
- A `Solution` class where you implement your solution
- A `TestSolution` class for writing test cases
- Type hints for better code clarity
- Common data structures and algorithms imports

## How to Use

1. Copy the `leetcode_template.py` file and rename it to match your problem (e.g., `two_sum.py`)
2. Modify the `Solution` class:
   - Rename the `solve` method to match the problem's requirements
   - Update the method signature with proper input and output types
   - Implement your solution
3. Add test cases in the `TestSolution` class
4. Run the tests using:
   ```bash
   python your_solution_file.py
   ```

## Common Data Structures and Algorithms

The template includes imports for:
- Lists, Dictionaries, and Optional types
- Defaultdict and Deque from collections
- Heapq for priority queues
- Math module for mathematical operations

## Tips

1. Always add type hints to your solution methods
2. Write test cases for edge cases
3. Consider time and space complexity
4. Add comments explaining your approach
5. Use descriptive variable names
