## üöÄ How to Use

### Running Individual Files
```bash
# Run a specific topic
python arrays_and_hashing.py
python two_pointers.py
python stack.py
python binary_search.py
python sliding_window.py
```

### Practice Workflow
1. **Read the Problem**: Each problem includes a detailed description, examples, and constraints
2. **Implement Your Solution**: Replace the `pass` statement with your implementation
3. **Test Your Code**: Run the file to see if your solution passes all test cases
4. **Check Complexity**: Each function includes expected time and space complexity

### Example Problem Structure
```python
# Problem: Two Sum
"""
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers 
such that they add up to target...

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
"""

def two_sum(nums, target):
    """
    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(n)
    """
    # Your solution here
    pass

# Test cases
def test_two_sum():
    print(two_sum([2,7,11,15], 9))  # Expected: [0,1]
```

## üìä Difficulty Levels

These problems range from **Easy** to **Hard** and are carefully selected to build your skills progressively:

- **Easy**: Basic implementations, good for warming up
- **Medium**: More complex logic, common interview questions
- **Hard**: Advanced techniques, test your problem-solving skills

## üéØ Learning Tips

1. **Start with Easy Problems**: Begin with simpler problems to build confidence
2. **Understand the Pattern**: Each topic has recurring patterns - identify them
3. **Practice Time Management**: Try to solve problems within 20-30 minutes
4. **Review Solutions**: After solving, think about alternative approaches
5. **Focus on Complexity**: Always consider time and space complexity

## üîß Customization

You can easily add more problems or modify existing ones:
- Add new problems following the same structure
- Modify test cases to include edge cases
- Add your own helper functions
- Create additional practice sets

## üìö Additional Resources

While these are offline practice problems, you can enhance your learning by:
- Reviewing solutions on NeetCode.io when online
- Watching NeetCode's video explanations
- Discussing solutions with peers
- Practicing similar problems on LeetCode
